You are a tiny guy on a tiny planet, or maybe your big and the planet is of regular size, but there is nothing around to compare it to. 
So you are looking for ice cream, or icecream however you want to spell it. 
You are probably hungry, or at least you think you are.

Here starts your journey through 4 maps in a fantastic action / jump 'n run / adventure / physics game that lasts about 3 minutes of playtime!
You will meet aliens, someone who works in a ph0toshop and cats!

The game is marvelous, because it's friendly to the disabled! 
You're color blind? No problem! This game only contains black and white colors! 
You're deaf? Not a problem! When you play this game you enjoy it like all the other people, because it has no sound!

And the most important thing about the game is: it has crates, or boxes (at least one of them).




Hey, I just wanted to add that I created this game with cocos2d javascript and it's done totally without flash and totally with html5 only! 

I can't figure out how to edit this. So here's that whole thing zipped in case I should rename the github project: http://bayfiles.com/file/8kCR/De44qO/iblic_-_Ive_been_looking_for_ice_cream.zip

There will be a timelapse soon, once I filtered out all the private stuff I recorded by accident (like bayimg delete links).
