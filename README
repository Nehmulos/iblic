So you are looking for ice cream, or icecream however you want to spell it.

Here starts your journey through 4 maps in a fantastic action / jump 'n run / adventure / physics game that lasts about 3 minutes of playtime!
You will meet aliens, someone who works in a ph0toshop and cats!

The game is marvelous, because it's friendly to the disabled! 
You're color blind? No problem! This game only contains black and white colors! 
You're deaf? Not a problem! When you play this game you enjoy it like all the other people, because it has no sound!
